   :description lang=en: General info about Faze4 robotic arm.


Faze4 robotic arm came to be when i made a working 3d printable cycloidal gearbox and saw some potential in it. After that i designed whole arm around it. It uses 6 stepper motors, so it is a 6 axis robot arm. While designing this arm i focused on low backlash and good design of arm. All wires are hidden and arm is really rigid even tho it is 3d printed. Total cost of the arm is around 1000 - 1500 dollars.

.. note::

    This project is still work in progres. Part that is work in progres is control cabinet, that means that the arm can be built and it     will work without the cabinet.

Esthetic design was inspired by FANUCâ€™s LR Mate 200iD. 
Goal was also to hide all wires in the arm like most industrial arms do. 
Only visible wires (or pipes) would be ones for gripper. 

Weight of the arm is around 14-15 kg , but it can be reduced by printing with less infill.

Low level control for the arm runs on teesny 3.5, while high level (inverse kinemtaics, simulations) are only on Matlab code atm, but I am working on ROS implementation and porting my Matlab code to Python.
