   :description lang=en: Instructions and tips to build mechanical part of the arm.
   
.. note::

   All parts can be bought from ebay and similiar online stores. I bought all steppers,drivers and PSUs from stepper online. You can buy    screws used for this arm in online stores but i sourced them locally and that was much cheaper. I also recommend to buy wires (you      will need them to extemd stepper wires) locally since ones on ebay and similar stores are of questionable quality.

You can find bom in this excel document and in building instructions file.

.. Tip::

   I also recommend to buy more items like bearinngs and screws than you need since you might destroy or damage some in building            process.
