   :description lang=en: Instructions and tips to build mechanical part of the arm.
   
.. note::

All parts can be bought from ebay and similiar online stores. I bought all steppers,drivers and PSUs from stepper online. You can buy screws used for this arm in online stores but i sourced them locally and that was much cheaper. I also recommend to buy wires (you will need them to extemd stepper wires) locally since ones on ebay and similar stores are of questionable quality.


BOM
------------
You can find bom in this excel document and in building instructions file. 

.. Tip::

I also recommend to buy more items like bearinngs and screws than you need since you might destroy or damage some in building process.

Print settings and tips
------------------------

I printed all smaller parts with 0.15 layer height and all larger with 0.35 layer height.For infill try to stay in 25%-30% range. I used 3 outer parimeters and 7 top and 5 bottom layers.

.. Tip::

   When printing larger parts like: x x x , try to print at slower speeds and with small accelerations.Since those parts are really        large and heavy they tend to cause missing steps when reaching the end of 3d print due the inertia.
