   :description lang=en: Instructions and tips to build mechanical part of the arm.
   
.. note::

   All parts can be bought from ebay and similiar online stores. I bought all steppers,drivers and PSUs from stepper online. You can buy    screws used for this arm in online stores but i sourced them locally and that was much cheaper. I also recommend to buy wires (you      will need them to extemd stepper wires) locally since ones on ebay and similar stores are of questionable quality.


BOM
------------
You can find bom in this excel document and in building instructions file. 

.. Tip::

   I also recommend to buy more items like bearinngs and screws than you need since you might destroy or damage some in building            process.
